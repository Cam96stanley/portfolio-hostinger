        Hi, I'm Cameron! I’m a former medical professional who swapped needles
        and vacutainers for a keyboard and monitor. I loved being part of the
        process of taking a sick patient and helping them get healthy again.
        I’ve carried that same energy into web development, replacing patients
        with clients who have problems that need solutions. Bringing their ideas
        to life — whether it’s a simple navigation bar redesign or a complex app
        — sparks the same excitement I felt helping patients.

        When I’m not coding, I love spending time with my family. Whether it’s
        watching The Nightmare Before Christmas for the tenth time in a day with
        my daughter, chasing her and our corgi, Noodle, around the backyard,
        playing Satisfactory with my partner, or crying my way through the Water
        Temple in Ocarina of Time, these moments bring memorable fun and joy to
        my life.

        Another passion of mine is music. I’ve played violin and piano since I
        was 11 years old. I fell in love with the violin after attending a
        Florida Orchestra concert in fifth grade, and the rest is history.
        Learning to understand sheet music rewired how I think, helping me
        approach complex, logic-based problems with more confidence and
        deepening my love for tackling challenging problems with abstract
        solutions.
